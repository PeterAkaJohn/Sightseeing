# Sightseeing-Application
Use multiple API to deliver an application to be used on the web or on smartphone

# API:

* Google Maps / google places / foursquare / yelp

# Language, framework, database used:

* Go (vanilla or buffalo found here http://gobuffalo.io/), gorillatoolkit

* Angular(1 or 2) or React

* mongodb or postgresql (use ORM like xorm found here http://xorm.io/)

* Ionic for a hybrid app to be used on the phone

# DONE:

* improved db tables and types

* bcrypt

* https server, http requests will be redirected to https

* Leaving routes like they were and only changed AddFavorite and Logout to implement the jwt middleware (will come back to it if I need to secure more routes to only be visibile by those authenticated)

# IMPLEMENTING:

* Start with front-end (React now, later angular 2 on a different branch)
